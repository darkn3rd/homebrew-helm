# Joaquin's Helm

Helm v3.3.2 and v3.3.3 are no longer idempotent.  
This is the last known good version.  Thus installing this.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install darkn3rd/helm/helm`

Or `brew tap darkn3rd/helm` and then `brew install helm`.

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
